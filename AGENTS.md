# Deep Dive Agent

A structured agent for tackling complex development tasks through research, innovation, and planning phases, with integrated GitHub issue management.

## When to Use

- Understand a complex codebase before making changes
- Explore multiple solution approaches for a problem
- Create detailed implementation plans before coding
- Manage GitHub issues with structured workflows

---

## Global Practices

### GitHub Default Context

When working with GitHub-related operations:

- **Default repository**: `vm0-ai/vm0` - Use this when no specific repository is mentioned
- **"me" / "my"**: Refers to GitHub user `hulh122` (https://github.com/hulh122)

Examples:
- "list my PRs" → `gh pr list --author hulh122`
- "show repo issues" → `gh issue list -R vm0-ai/vm0`
- "assign this issue to me" → `gh issue edit {id} --add-assignee hulh122`

### Code Repository Analysis

When the user mentions a code repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.):

1. **Clone the repository** for local analysis
   ```bash
   # Clone specific version/tag
   git clone --depth 1 --branch {tag/branch} {repo-url} /tmp/{repo-name}

   # Or clone latest
   git clone --depth 1 {repo-url} /tmp/{repo-name}
   ```

2. **Analyze locally** - Read files, understand structure, explore architecture
3. **Reference findings** - Include file paths and line numbers in research/analysis

This enables deeper analysis than browsing online, allowing full codebase exploration.

### Thinking Principles

- **Systems Thinking** - Analyze from architecture to implementation
- **Dialectical Thinking** - Understand multiple aspects and trade-offs
- **Critical Thinking** - Verify understanding from multiple angles
- **Mapping** - Separate known from unknown elements

### Artifact Storage

All artifacts are stored in `deep-dive/{task-name}/`:

| File | Phase | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| `research.md` | Research | Codebase analysis, technical constraints |
| `innovate.md` | Innovate | Solution approaches, trade-offs |
| `plan.md` | Plan | Implementation steps, task breakdown |

### Prerequisites

- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) installed and authenticated for issue operations
- Run `gh auth status` to verify

### VM0 CLI Usage

If the `vm0` command is not installed on your system, you can use `npx` as an alternative:

```bash
# Instead of:
vm0 <command>

# Use:
npx -y @vm0/cli <command>
```

Both methods are functionally equivalent.

## Operation /issue-plan

**Usage:** `/issue-plan [issue-id]`

Start working on a GitHub issue by executing the complete deep-dive workflow.

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Fetch Issue Details

```bash
gh issue view {issue-id} --json title,body,comments,labels
```

#### Step 2: Check for Existing Artifacts

Look for existing work in `deep-dive/*/`:
- `research.md` - Research phase completed
- `innovate.md` - Innovation phase completed
- `plan.md` - Plan phase completed

#### Step 3: Execute Deep-Dive Workflow

Run phases automatically in sequence (no user confirmation between phases):

1. **Research Phase** - Analyze codebase, create `research.md`, post to issue
2. **Innovate Phase** - Explore solutions, create `innovate.md`, post to issue
3. **Plan Phase** - Create implementation plan, create `plan.md`, post to issue

#### Step 4: Finalize

1. Add "pending" label to wait for user approval
2. Exit and wait for user to review the plan

### Posting to Issue

After each phase, post the artifact as a comment:

```bash
gh issue comment {issue-id} --body-file deep-dive/{task-name}/research.md
gh issue comment {issue-id} --body-file deep-dive/{task-name}/innovate.md
gh issue comment {issue-id} --body-file deep-dive/{task-name}/plan.md
```

---

## Operation /issue-action

**Usage:** `/issue-action`

Continue working on a GitHub issue from conversation context, following the approved plan.

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Retrieve Context

1. Find issue ID from conversation history
2. Locate deep-dive artifacts in `deep-dive/{task-name}/`

#### Step 2: Fetch Latest Updates

```bash
gh issue view {issue-id} --json title,body,comments,labels
```

#### Step 3: Remove Pending Label

```bash
gh issue edit {issue-id} --remove-label pending
```

#### Step 4: Analyze Feedback

Review comments for:
- Plan approval/rejection
- Modification requests
- Additional requirements

#### Step 5: Take Action

- **Plan approved** → Proceed to implementation
- **Changes requested** → Update plan, post revised, add "pending" label
- **Questions asked** → Answer in comment, add "pending" label

#### Step 6: Implementation

1. Read `plan.md` for implementation steps
2. Create/switch to feature branch
3. Implement changes following plan exactly
4. Write and run tests after each change
5. Commit with conventional commit messages

#### Step 7: Create PR

1. Push branch and create Pull Request
2. Post completion comment to issue

```bash
gh issue comment {issue-id} --body "Work completed. PR created: {pr-url}"
```

## Operation /issue-create

**Usage:** `/issue-create [operation]`

Create GitHub issues from conversation context.

### Operations

- **create** - Create issue from conversation (flexible, adapts to content)
- **bug** - Create bug report with reproduction steps
- **feature** - Create feature request with acceptance criteria

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Analyze Conversation

Identify:
- What the user wants to accomplish
- The problem or need discussed
- Decisions or insights that emerged
- Relevant technical context

#### Step 2: Determine Issue Type

- Feature request or enhancement
- Bug report or defect
- Technical task or chore
- Documentation need

#### Step 3: Clarify with User

Ask 2-4 questions to confirm understanding and fill gaps.

#### Step 4: Create Issue

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[type]: [description]" \
  --body "[content]" \
  --label "[labels]" \
  --assignee @me
```

**Title format:** Conventional commit style
- `feat:` for features
- `bug:` for defects
- `docs:` for documentation
- `refactor:` for improvements

## Operation /issue-compact

**Usage:** `/issue-compact`

Consolidate issue discussion into clean body for handoff.

### Purpose

Enable handoff: someone unfamiliar with the history can pick up the issue and continue.

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Fetch Issue Content

```bash
gh issue view {issue-id} --json number,title,body,comments
```

#### Step 2: Analyze Context

Review conversation for:
- Requirement clarifications
- Design decisions
- Technical discoveries
- Plan adjustments

#### Step 3: Synthesize Content

Create new issue body that preserves:
- Original requirements and context
- Key decisions and rationale
- Technical constraints
- Current status and next steps
- Blockers or open questions

Add compact metadata:
```
---
> Compacted on YYYY-MM-DD from X comments
```

#### Step 4: Update Issue

```bash
gh issue edit {issue-id} --body-file issue-{issue-id}-compact.md
```

#### Step 5: Delete Comments

```bash
# Get repo info
gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '"\(.owner.login)/\(.name)"'

# Get and delete each comment
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue-id}/comments --jq '.[].id'
gh api -X DELETE repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment-id}
```

---

## Label Management

- **pending** - Waiting for user input (plan review, questions, blocked)
- Remove when resuming work
- Add when waiting for feedback

Create label if it doesn't exist:

```bash
gh label create pending --description "Waiting for human input" --color FFA500
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Complete phases in order** - Each phase builds on previous findings
2. **Don't skip phases** - Even simple tasks benefit from structured thinking
3. **Keep artifacts updated** - Reference and update docs as understanding evolves
4. **Get approval before implementing** - The plan is a contract with the user
5. **Follow conventional commits** - feat / fix / docs / refactor / test / chore
6. **Small iterations** - Implement focused changes with tests
7. **Verify each change** - Run tests after each modification
8. **Don't deviate from plan** - Get approval for changes
9. **Reproduce bugs first** - Write failing test before fixing
